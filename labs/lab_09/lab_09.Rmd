## You will need

* A Census API key

## Load libraries and establish settings

**Task** Create a codeblock and load appropriate packages and settings for this lab.
```{r}
#scientific notation and packages 
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
#Census API key 
census_api_key("8d7ad09f8f8dd3b90a48c6afa09aa9e03b668fa5", overwrite=TRUE)
```

## Questions

**Q1.** Which day in April 2020 saw the most loans approved in West Virginia? 

You MUST do the following things when answering this question:
* Use the WV ppp loan data, which is in the data folder and is called lab_09.rds.
* Make a line chart with ggplot that:
  * has each date in April (i.e. 04-01-20, 04-02-20) labeled on the x axis (and only dates in April, no other month). To clarify, no data for any other month than April 2020 should appear on the chart. 
  * sets the height of the line for any given date -- its y axis value -- to the total number of loans on that date.
  * has an appropriate title, source, and x and y axis titles. 
  * adds a small circle (called a "point") on the line for dates that had loans. And to the left of each circle/point, shows the number of loans on that date.  I didn't show you how to do this in the prelab, so do some web sleuthing to figure it out! 

Basically, your chart should look like this image, which will appear when you run the codeblock below. 
```{r}
#load in data
wv_ppp_loans <- read_rds("data/lab_09.rds")
```
```{r}
#lets find the answer!
wv_ppp_by_date <- wv_ppp_loans %>%
  filter(between(date_approved, as.Date("2020-04-05"), as.Date("2020-04-30"))) %>%
  group_by(date_approved) %>%
  summarise( total_loans = n()
  ) 

wv_ppp_by_date

#chart
wv_ppp_by_date %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=date_approved, y=total_loans)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 day", date_labels = "%m-%d-%y") +
   theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,  hjust=1)
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x=date_approved, y=total_loans)) +
  geom_text(aes(label=total_loans, x=date_approved, y= total_loans), hjust= 1.3, vjust=1) +
  labs(
    title="Dates with the Most PPP Loans in West Virginia",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Total Loans",
    caption = "source: SBA PPP loan database"
    )
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chart_1.png"))
```

**A1.** 
04-28-20 had the most loans, with 2381. 

**Q2.** What are the top 10 states that got the most PPP loans per 100,000 people? You MUST do the following things when answering this question:

* Make a codeblock below to write your code in.
* Use the csv of total PPP loans by state in the data folder (state_ppp_all) as your source for total PPP loans by state.  
* Use the tidycensus API to get a table of total population by state from the American Community Survey (ACS). To do this, you'll use use the alphanumeric variable for total population, which has the following "label" and "concept": "Estimate!!Total:" and "SEX BY AGE". 
* Use ggplot to make a horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 states, with the length of the bar determined by the state's total PPP loans per 100,000 people. Give it an appropriate title, source, and x and y axis titles. 
* Make the bars on the chart blue! I didn't show you how to do this in the prelab, so do some web sleuthing to figure it out. 
```{r}
#load data
state_ppp <- read_csv("data/state_ppp_all.csv")
acs_data <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache =TRUE)
#create a dataframe for it 
total_population_by_state <- get_acs(geography = "state",
              variables = c(pop="B01001_001"),
              year = 2019) %>%
rename(state=NAME) %>%
rename(population= estimate)%>%
    mutate(state = case_when(
    state == "South Dakota" ~ "S Dakota",
    state== "North Dakota" ~ "N Dakota",
    TRUE ~ state
   )) 
#join this with our state data
  total_with_states <- total_population_by_state %>%
  inner_join(state_ppp,by=c("state")) %>%
  select(-variable, -moe, -GEOID) %>%
  mutate(
    per_100k=(total_ppp_loans/population)*100000
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(per_100k))%>%
  head(10)
  
  total_with_states
  
#bar chart
  total_with_states%>%
    ggplot() +
     geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(state,per_100k), weight=per_100k,), fill="blue") +
     labs(title="Top 10 States with the Most PPP Loans per 100K People",
          x= "State",
          y= "Number of Loans",
          caption= "Source: SBA PPP Loan Database and ACS Census Data")
  
```
**A2.** The 10 states with the most PPP loans per 100,000 people, as displayed in the chart are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Montana. 

**Q3.**  A scatterplot is a type of chart that helps us see relationships between two variables. One variable goes on the x axis, the other on the y axis.  For each row/observation in our data, a scatterplot puts a circle (or a "point") where the two variables intersect on a grid. 

Statisticians use scatterplots to show graphically whether one variable is correlated -- related, in a statistical sense -- with another variable.  A classic example is the [relationship between ice cream sales and temperature](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/scatter-xy-plots.html).  The scatterplot below (press play to load the image) shows that relationship, that an increase in temperature is associated with an increase in ice cream sales. When it's 12C, sales are 200 dollars, and when it's hotter, 25C, sales are 600 dollars.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chart_2.png"))
```

We're going to use a scatterplot a little differently, to get a visual sense of two key variables: the amount of an approved PPP loan, and the amount that was later forgiven. We'll use it to answer some questions in a broad sense, about loan forgiveness.  This is just a jumping off point for further exploration. 

Our questions include: Were there a lot of people who had their loans fully forgiven?  Were there a lot of people who didn't have their loans forgiven? Were there a lot of people who had some of the loan forgiven? 

To answer those questions, make a codeblock and do the following:

1. Start with the a subset of the WV ppp loan data we loaded earlier.
2. Filter the data to examine only those loans less than $25,000.
3. There are a bunch of NAs in the forgiveness amount column, for the purposes of this assignment only, let's assume those are actually supposed to be 0. So make all the NAs 0. 
4. Make a scatterplot. I didn't show you how to do this, so look it up! 
5. In the answer space below, describe what you see and answer the questions posed above.  In a general sense, what do you think this means?
```{r}
under_25k <-wv_ppp_loans%>%
  filter(amount <= 25000)%>%
  mutate(forgiveness_amount = case_when(
    is.na(forgiveness_amount) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ forgiveness_amount
  ))

under_25k%>%
 ggplot(aes(x=amount, y=forgiveness_amount))+
 geom_point(size=1) 
  
```

**A3.** Based on the scatter plot, there were a lot of people that had their loans fully forgiven, as there are a lot of points huddled on the slope line that appears at the top.The points in the center represent those who had their loans partially forgiven. As we can see, there are a very fair amount of people this happened to. There is also a number of people who didn't have any of their loans forgiven, as shown by the thick line on the bottom. This line is a bunch of data points huddled together.
