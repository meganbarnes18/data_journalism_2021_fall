#first we should filter the data to see just our open cases

  filter(disposition=="Open/No arrest") %>%
  select(city, state, disposition)

#now we can find the totals for each city and arrange them spo we can see the city with the highest number of open cases

    group_by(city) %>%

#As we can see, Chicago has the most unsolved homicides with 3686. Baltimore is second with 1673 folowed by Detroit with 146.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
